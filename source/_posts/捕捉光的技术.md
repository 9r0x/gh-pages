# Photography Foundations:

> Shooting is about light

## Light control

💡 One stop = half/double difference of light

🍗 Light can create contrast and reveal texture

### **Shutter speed**

1. Can blur moving object if longer than 1/60s
2. Longer → brighter
3. One stop = double/half shutter speed

### **Aperture**

1. Bigger number means smaller size(f/11 is smaller than f/4)
2. Larger → brighter
3. Common sizes with one stop difference
    - 1.4
    - 2
    - 2.8
    - 4
    - 5.6
    - 8
    - 11
    - 16

### **ISO**

1. Affects noise
2. Larger → brighter & more noise
3. One stop = double/half shutter speed

## Depth of fields

⚠️ Fast lens may cause very low DoF when shooting close-up portraits

- Increase with smaller aperture
- Increase with smaller sensor
- Decrease when aperture is very small due to diffraction
- Very low DoF creates bokeh

# SLR operation

🍗 Shoot in RAW

⚠️ Don't put lenses cap in pocket

⚠️ LCD screen may not reflect actual image

## Modes

- **Auto**

    Little control

- **P**

    A little more control

- **S**

    Shutter speed Priority

- **A**

    Aperture Priority

- **M**

    Manual(Light meter indicates whether under/over exposure)

## Focal lengths(mm)

🍗 Optical stabilization > Digital stabilization

- 16-24 → Ultra wide
- 28-35 → Wide
- 50 → Normal
- 300 → Telephoto
- 600+ → Very telephoto

## Exposure Bracketing

- Creates HDR(High dynamic range) picture
- Use larger gap when bracketing at night

## Flash

- Fill the shadow obscuring details
- Fill the uneven exposure (e.g. wearing a hat)

## Heuristics

- Sunny 16 rule(*With ample light*)

$$Aperture = F/16 \rightarrow Shutter\\_speed = \frac{1}{ISO}$$

- Actual focal length

$$F_{Actual} = F_{Lenses} \times Crop\\_Factor$$

- Actual F number

$$F_{Actual} = F_{Lenses} \times Crop\\_Factor$$

- Handheld rule

$$Shutter\\_speed > \frac 1 F$$

- Minutes before sunset(*Fingers between the sun and horizon*)

$$Fingers \times 7$$

## Focus

🍗 Switch to MF to lock focus

- AF
- MF

## Common filters

- UV
- Circular polarizer
- Infrared
- Starburst effect

## Maintenance

- Don't use bottled air, use air blower
- Pay attention to the connecting part
- Sensor cleaning

# Techniques

⚠️ Never fear at acting like a lame photographer

## Backlit

- Adjust metering mode when light is distributed unevenly
- Exposure compensation
- Fill flash

## Black and white

⚠️ Black is always blacker when printed

💡 High-key = The tonal range consists mostly of lighter tones

💡 Low-key = The tonal range consists mostly of darker tones

- Geometry

    Whether subject is defined

- Tone

    Light and shadow

- Contrast

    Black needs to be true black

## Composition

⚠️ What cannot fit in a scene is usually a subject-less background

🍗 Rule of three to create the feeling of repetition

🍗 Focus on the light that suits the subject instead of the subject

- Clearly defined subject and background
- Show Point of view
- Reveal hidden scene, patterns, etc.
- Sense of balance
- About seeing the details brain has omitted
- Degree of simplicity

## Practice seeing

- Use peripheral vision to see subjects
- Misname things to force yourself to see

## Portrait

🍗 Use building to cover light when in unbalanced light

🍗 Shoot in back light when in open space and low sunlight angle

- Less extra space above person
- More space towards the person's attention
- Cut between joints
- Find interesting texture and bring subject in
- Use a little telephoto lens

## Color

- Weight
- Simplicity
- Emotional quality

## Guiding

- Lines
- Narrative
- Framing
    - Tonal
    - Physical

## Noises

💡 Luminance noise = change of brightness from px to px

💡 Chromatic noise = change of color from px to px

💡 Stuck pixel noise = super bright points because of stuck pixel

- Balance noise and blur
- Keeps a min shutter speed even with high ISO
